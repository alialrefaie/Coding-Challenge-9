# D3.js Interactive Div Elements

This project involves creating a web page that uses D3.js to make div elements interactive. Each div will represent a data point and change appearance when hovered over.

## Tasks
-Create an HTML file, include the D3.js library in the head section by adding a `<script>` tag, add another `<script>` tag to link to external JAvaScript file where D3.js code is implemented.
-Include a `<style>` tag in the head section of HTML file and define styles for the div elements to represent data points, specifying height, width, and initial background color.
-Create an external JavaScript file, write a function to initialize page that creates div elements as data points and attaches interactive behaviors using D3.js, and attach event listeners for "mouseover" and "mouseout" to change the div elements' styles on hover and rever them when the mouse moves away
-On "mouseover", change the div's background color to a more vibrant one, on "mouseout", revert the div's background color to its original state.
